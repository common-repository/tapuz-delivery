A plugin for Tapuz Delivery orders from within WooCommerce.

== Description ==

The HATAMMY WooCommerce plug-in enables Tapuz delivery clients to order delivery pickups straight from the order details page within WooCommerce, without the need to log-in and submit each delivery manually in Tapuz’s web based ordering system. The plug-in saves time and potential human errors.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Yes it does. If your WordPress installation is set to Hebrew the plugin will display text in Hebrew.

= What does this plugin require? =


The plugin requires:
1. WooCommerce plugin installed and active.
2. User code, user name and password from Tapuz delivery.

= What might happen if WordPress or WooCommerce receive an update that’ll render this plug-in as incompatible?

The worst thing that should happen is that the plug-in will stop functioning. It does not use any core WordPress/WooCommerce elements thus should not affect your store from functioning.
